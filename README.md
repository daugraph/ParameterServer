# ParameterServer
ParameterServer is an implementation for [dmlc/ps-lite](https://github.com/dmlc/ps-lite) in java, which is a light and efficient
implementation of the parameter server framework, and can be easily used to implementing distributed deep learning training framework, 
such as [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), 
[MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet), etc.
